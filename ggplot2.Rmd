##1. Subsetting Data

Loading in data, and manipulating a few columns
```{r loading in data, echo=TRUE}
d <- read.csv("Dataset_S1.txt", sep= ',', header=TRUE) #reading in data and calling it d
head(d) #checking data to see if imported correctly
colnames(d) [12] <- "percent.GC" #renamed column 12 percent.GC 
d$diversity <- d$Pi/(10*1000) # rescale  diversity estimates from last class
d$cent <- d$start >= 25800000 & d$end <= 29700000 #identify each row as in being in the centromere or not in the centromere 
```

Which values of the vector conforms to our specifications
```{r SNPs, echo=TRUE}
d$total.SNPs >= 85 #number of SNPs 
d[d$total.SNPs >=85,] #this extracts rows with greater than or equal to 85 SNPs
```
